## Description

MERN full-stack application that allows The Sun Hotel's customers to login and book a reservation, as well as to learn more about the hotel. 

### User Story
                As a hotel owner, 
                I want a strong website
                So that I can attract more customers. 

### Acceptance Criteria
                GIVEN a MERN hotel-booking website
                WHEN I land at the homepage, 
                THEN I see a navigation bar with options for Home, Dining, Reservation, Review, and Login 
                WHEN I sign up or log in
                THEN I can create a reservation
                WHEN I am logged in
                THEN I can see my reservations and cancel them; update my email, and write a review
                WHEN I land on the review page
                THEN I see all user reviews
